Features:
-Both of the extra credit problems have been done.
-Uses Chart.js for the second problem from this website (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.1.4/Chart.min.js)
â€¦

Known Issues:
-Program was tested using FireFox, and only works in that browser
-difficult to test extra credit part one as function is reliant on API updating temp, feels like temp, and humidity to different values for comparison
 added a couple screenshots from testing

Other:
-Program refreshes the values instantly for the top column.  The refresh method still refreshes this as well.
-Graph for the second extra credit is large, but a given size was not specified.
