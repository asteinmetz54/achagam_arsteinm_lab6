Features:
-Both of the extra credit problems have been done.
-Uses Chart.js for the second problem from this website (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.1.4/Chart.min.js)
-The last city is filled in ahead of time, as the instructions didn't specify otherwise.
-When refreshed, the timestamp sometimes doesn't change while the rest of the values do.  This is a quirk of
the source JSON object (using the API viewer shows the same result), not an issue with the code.
-Program refreshes the values instantly for the top column.  The refresh method still refreshes this as well.

Known Issues:
-Added a couple screenshots from testing
